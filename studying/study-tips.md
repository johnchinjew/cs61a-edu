# How I Like to Study

0. If you are super behind, catch up fast! Watch missed lectures and use discussion worksheets and labs as lecture-practice material
1. Throughout your studying, write down everything that surprises you on your cheatsheet!
2. Do a practice test, identify what you need to focus on for studying. Focus on topics and types of problems that seem ambiguous to you or you feel unconfident with.
3. Review such topics using hw/lab/discussion questions, focused guides and resources on the [website](https://cs61a.org/resources.html), and most importantly, specific test questions that will help strengthen your weaknesses
4. Lastly, try to do one or two (of the most recent) more practice tests, to continue building your test-taking confidence and familiarity with types of problems

If you don't have time to do all that, focus on taking one or two practice tests and whenever you encounter something you don't know, consult your resources to figure it out and write it down on your cheatsheet.
